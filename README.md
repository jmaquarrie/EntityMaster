# EntityMaster

Interactive system/entity diagram you can open directly in a browser.

## Getting started

1. Open `index.html` in your preferred browser (double-click in Finder/Explorer or run a local static server).
2. Use **Add System** to place a new system node, drag it to position it, and use the circular connector to draw links between systems.
3. Select a system to manage its entities and domain tags. Domains appear as bubbles under each system and are also available as global filters along the top of the page.
4. Click a domain chip to highlight every system that belongs to that domain, or click **Clear Highlights** to reset the canvas.

No build tools or dependencies are required.
