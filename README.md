# EntityMaster

Interactive system/entity diagram you can open directly in a browser.

## Getting started

1. Open `index.html` in your preferred browser (double-click in Finder/Explorer or run a local static server).
2. Use **Add System** to place a new system node, drag it to position it, and use the circular connector to draw links between systems. Zoom controls sit in the toolbar so you can zoom in/out as diagrams grow.
3. Select a system to manage its entities, domain tags, and the new **Platform Owner** and **Business Owner** text fields in the floating panel on the left.
4. The slim filter/search sidebar on the right lets you:
   - Run scoped searches (system, domain, platform owner, business owner, or entity) to highlight matching systems.
   - Filter by individual Platform/Business owner text.
   - Toggle domain chips to highlight/tag related systems.
   - Use **Clear Highlights** at any time to reset every filter/search.

No build tools or dependencies are required.
